# ATAL – AI Traceability & Accountability Ledger  
Public Review Draft v0.9

---

## 1. Overview

ATAL (AI Traceability & Accountability Ledger) is a vendor-neutral, implementation-independent standard for recording, governing, and auditing the decisions made by AI systems.  
It ensures that every AI action — whether initiated by a human or generated autonomously — is tied to a complete, tamper-evident evidence trail.

ATAL enables regulators, enterprises, auditors, and courts to reconstruct what happened, why it happened, and whether it was permissible.

This repository contains the reference documentation for the ATAL Standard.

## 2. The 0th Law of AI Accountability

Any AI system capable of initiating or escalating actions without direct human instruction MUST be governed by an external, independent accountability layer that can observe, restrict, pause, override, or terminate those actions.

This principle anchors ATAL’s autonomy governance model.

## 3. Structure of the ATAL Standard

The full ATAL Specification is organized into nine Parts:

1. **PART I – Human-Initiated AI Governance**  
2. **PART II – Autonomous AI Governance**  
3. **PART III – Decision Trails**  
4. **PART IV – Self-Modification Ledger (SML)**  
5. **PART V – Emergent Intent Tracking (EIT)**  
6. **PART VI – Composite Accountability Graph (CAG)**  
7. **PART VII – Human-Initiated Risk (HIR) Tiers**  
8. **PART VIII – Autonomy Risk Tiers (ART)**  
9. **PART IX – Safety Kernel & Oversight Protocols**

The full specification is located at:

``docs/ATAL_Specification_v0.9.md``

## 4. Repository Contents

This repository contains:

- **ATAL Primer**  
  Conceptual overview of the entire standard.

## 5. Philosophy and Design Goals

ATAL is built on the following principles:

- **Traceability**  
  Every AI action must produce a verifiable Decision Trail.

- **Accountability**  
  Actions must be attributable to a human, policy, or autonomy pathway.

- **Safety**  
  Autonomy must remain within declared and governed ART tiers.

- **Evidence Integrity**  
  Records must be tamper-evident, cryptographically verifiable, and complete.

- **Neutrality**  
  The standard is not tied to any vendor, toolchain, or model family.

- **Regulatory Alignment**  
  Consistent with DPDPA, CERT-In, EU AI Act, ISO/IEC 42001, and global AI governance perspectives.

## 6. Intended Audience

This repository is for:

- regulators and policymakers  
- enterprises and governance teams  
- AI architects and engineers  
- auditors and legal professionals  
- researchers and safety practitioners  
- standards bodies and oversight agencies

## 7. Public Review Period

ATAL v0.9 is released for a 30-day global public review.  
During this phase:

- all feedback must be submitted via GitHub Issues  
- pull requests are not accepted  
- revisions will be tracked transparently  
- the Steward makes final editorial decisions  

After the review window, a v1.0 release candidate will be prepared.

## 9. Important Notes

- This repo will form the basis of the public `atal-standard` repository.  
- Internal or non-standard files (e.g., draft notes, status logs) are not included in public releases.  
- Only the specification carries version numbers; supporting documents do not.

---

## 10. How to Engage

- Read the Primer for conceptual grounding  
- Review the Specification for compliance requirements  
- Submit feedback through Issues during the review window  
- Track changes through the changelog template and governance documents
