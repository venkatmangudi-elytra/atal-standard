# About ATAL  
Public Review Draft v0.9

---

## 1. Purpose

ATAL (AI Traceability & Accountability Ledger) is a comprehensive standard designed to make AI systems transparent, auditable, accountable, and safe.  
Its goal is to ensure that every AI action — human-triggered or autonomous — is recorded in a way that supports regulatory scrutiny, forensic reconstruction, and operational governance.

ATAL provides a unified, structured, tamper-evident approach to documenting AI decisions across all model types, industries, and jurisdictions.

---

## 2. Why ATAL Exists

AI systems increasingly make decisions with material, legal, financial, or safety consequences.  
However:

- AI decisions are often opaque  
- tool and model chains are complex  
- evidence is hard to recreate  
- autonomy risks are rising  
- existing logs lack forensic integrity  

ATAL provides a single answer to all of these challenges by defining:

- what must be recorded  
- how it must be structured  
- how oversight must operate  
- how autonomy must be governed  
- how causality must be reconstructed  

ATAL is not a monitoring tool or product.  
It is a **standard** for accountability.

## 3. The 0th Law of AI Accountability

Any AI system capable of initiating or escalating actions without direct human instruction MUST be governed by an external, independent accountability layer that can observe, restrict, pause, override, or terminate those actions.

This is the central principle of autonomy governance and applies to any system with decision-making capabilities.

---

## 4. Scope of ATAL

ATAL covers:

- human-initiated AI actions  
- autonomy-capable AI actions  
- per-decision evidence capture  
- model/toolchain provenance  
- self-modification tracking  
- emergent intent detection  
- full causal lineage representation  
- safety kernel enforcement  
- human- and autonomy-based risk tiers  
- governance and oversight structures  

The full specification is structured into nine Parts (I–IX).  
Consult the primer or the specification for details of each Part.

---

## 5. Regulatory Alignment

ATAL is designed to support compliance with:

- DPDPA (India)  
- CERT-In Directions  
- EU AI Act  
- ISO/IEC 42001 (AI Management System)  
- sectoral frameworks (financial services, healthcare, critical infrastructure)  

It provides regulators with an independent, forensic-ready foundation for overseeing AI systems.

---

## 6. Vendor-Neutral and Globally Applicable

ATAL does not prescribe:

- which AI models to use  
- which cloud or vendor to adopt  
- how a product must be architected  

Instead, it defines the **mandatory evidence structures** and **governance requirements** that any system must meet to be considered accountable.

Any organisation can implement ATAL on top of their existing infrastructure.

---

## 7. Relationship to Implementations

ATAL is the standard.  
Implementations (including the reference implementation maintained separately by Elytra Security) must conform to ATAL.  
This repository contains no implementation code.

The standard remains vendor-neutral, globally applicable, and open for public review.

---

## 8. Intended Beneficiaries

ATAL is designed for:

- regulators  
- auditors  
- enterprises  
- policymakers  
- system architects  
- legal professionals  
- AI-risk and AI-safety researchers  

It supports transparency and trust in all levels of AI deployment.

---

## 9. Evolution and Lifecycle

The ATAL Standard evolves through:

- public review cycles  
- structured governance  
- editorial and steward oversight  
- versioned specifications  

All changes are documented transparently.  
The current release (v0.9) is open for public review.
